Feel free to use the bot code as you see fit, you will have to link back to this repo though to credit.

No one can use this code to charge others for the use of the bot, It's open-source!

I would prefer people helping to enhance the bot, however not everything will be merged, pending review of code,
if that is the case, feel free to fork it but again link back to this repo.

Any modifications to other repo's forked from this, has no consequence on this code or myself, and there is no liability
or warranty accepted for mis-use of the code.
