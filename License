Feel free to use the bot code as you see fit, but be sure to credit me (somewhere relevant)...
I won't charge for anyone to use this bot, and I don't expect anyone to be able to charge anyone for this bot, or modified versions
if the source is from here. (Donations are exempt due to run costs, dev time etc... but it's donations)

If you use the code from here, be sure to star the repository, and I would prefer people helping to enhance the bot, however not everything
will be merged, if that is the case, feel free to fork it.

I also offer no warranty and/or damage liability if you use this code, or modify it.
